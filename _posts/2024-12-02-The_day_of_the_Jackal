## The day of the Jackal

The male lead is so charismatic.
His acting is great. I believe he is the Jackal.
He assassinated people for being paid and is really good at disguising.
I thought he would kill his wife after she found part of his secret, but he didn’t.
He just made up another lies to his wife and kept deceiving her. Jackal really loves her.

The shots are stunning and the pace of the story is incredible.
There are at least two families are suffering from their jobs.
Jackal has to leave his family for living and killing people.
Bianca has to leave her family for capturing the Jackal.
All families are struggling and messed up.
The contrast is quite striking.

The only thing that makes me feel I couldn’t give a full 10 stars is what the female lead did in the show.
Yes, as a MI6 officer.
She intimidated a woman(but was a criminal) with her daughter, who is just going to college.
Okay. That’s fine. But that causes the death of the young girl indirectly.
Well, I don’t understand. So I had to deduct one star. I can’t sit through her scenes anymore.
It’s a little bit awful.
